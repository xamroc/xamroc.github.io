        <h2>Web Development Immersive</h2>
        <p>The Hong Kong tech community is still a lot smaller than NYC, a similarly sized city, but much more of a presence than before. There are investors in early-stage startups. They might come from HK people who become angels to diversify their portfolios or it might come from raising a few early-stage funds. Startups will locate teams in HK. Not as a gateway to China, but as a gateway to Asia and to international business.</p>
        <p>WDI is General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course. Immersive means all day, every day, weekends and weeknights, sometimes in foreign places, for 12 weeks straight. In Hong Kong, 13 unique individuals from different reaches of the world, all reconfigured into SCRUM teams of full-stack Ruby on Rails developers and JavaScript maniacs. After weeks of training, thousand of lines of code, and a lot of Thai food, we're ready and excited to go on a hacker adventure!</p>
